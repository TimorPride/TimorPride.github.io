## Dev setup

1. Install Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Serve locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`



For troubleshooting, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#step-2-install-jekyll-using-bundler

In particular, had to switch to a newer gcc before running `bundle install`, using instructions in https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/653#issuecomment-489359474
