# Description

Timor-Leste‚Äôs LGBTI community is a powerful force for inclusion and acceptance. In a region growing increasingly hostile to the community, we compel support from all walks of life: the church, civil society, international groups and all the way up to the country‚Äôs leaders. Now, we‚Äôre inviting you.

Following the success of our first-ever Pride event, 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄòFree to be me‚Äô, our acceptance-themed Pride march in 2017 garnered jubilant international attention and a public endorsement from our then-prime minister. This year, youth group Hatutan joins forces with Fundasaun CODIVA, Arco Iris and other partners for a Pride celebration calling for the inclusion of LGBTI people in the country‚Äôs development.

<p class="tc black-90 f3 fw4">
Timor-Leste must strive to protect human rights and to ensure inclusion for all. If you agree, join us this July.
