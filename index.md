  Celebrate Pride with the youngest and loudest nation in Southeast Asia.
</p>

# Description


Timor-Leste’s Pride parades have increased the country's global visibility and put this small nation on the map. 

But in their daily lives, the Timorese LGBTI community isn't as visible due to constant stigma and discrimination. The theme for this year's Pride is "Visibility," to bring light into a community that has long been sidelined and forced to live in the shadows. 

July this year marks 20 years since the Timorese people voted for independence and freedom from oppression. The principles and values of freedom should also apply to every individual in this country - to be able to live visibly and proudly with their true identity.
