# Description

Following the success of “Free to be me,” the first Pride event that was held in Dili in June 2016, the Hatutan youth group working together with other partners, organized Timor-Leste’s second LGBTI Pride in 2017 on the theme of “acceptance.”

This year the Hatutan youth group, together with Fundasaun CODIVA, Arco Iris and other partners, will organize another Pride parade on the theme of “inclusion,” to call for the inclusion of LGBTI people in the development of the country. Timor-Leste must live up to its reputation and should continue to strive to be a country that protects human rights and promotes inclusiveness for all.
